      <h3>My submission isn’t in the gallery</h3>
      <p>Your submission may not be appearing in the gallery for a few reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Your submission hasn't been reviewed yet. </strong>Your submission is made publicly visible only after it's been reviewed by the hackathon managers. Until that happens, only you and your team members can see it.</li>
        <li>
<strong>You've edited your submission.</strong> If you edit your submission after it's been published in the gallery, it will be unpublished and sent back to the hackathon managers' review queue. Until the hackathon manager re-reviews your submission, only you and your team members can see it.</li>
        <li>
<strong>The submission period hasn't ended yet.</strong> Some hackathon managers choose to wait until the end of the submission period to publish submissions in the gallery. If the submission period hasn't ended yet and no submissions have been published, then this is likely why.</li>
      </ul>
