      <h3>Things to Consider: Hackathon Rules and Requirements</h3>
      <p>You should absolutely work with a qualified attorney to create a set of Official Rules for your competition. Contests of skill have legal requirements and these vary by state and country. You should also involve your attorney if you have questions during the competition about updating, clarifying or interpreting the Official Rules.</p>

      <p>Below are some things to consider when working with your attorney to create the Official Rules and when applying the rules. These have been put together based on our experience powering hundreds of challenges.</p>
