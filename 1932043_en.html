<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the Hackathon Site tab, you&rsquo;ll provide information that will appear on the homepage of your hackathon. After you&rsquo;ve completed this tab, you can come back anytime to finish creating your hackathon<span class="s1">.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>About the hackathon</b><br />
<br />
Your description should provide an overview of the hackathon<span class="s1"> and answer the following questions: Who is running the hackathon<span class="s1">? What is the goal of the hackathon<span class="s1">? What are you asking people to submit?</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>Video</b> <br />
<br />
A compelling video can bring your hackathon<span class="s1"> to life and inspire the public to enter. If you decide to make a video, we encourage you to talk about what motivated your organization to create the hackathon<span class="s1"> and why people should participate.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>How to Enter</b><br />
<br />
Let users know what you are asking them to submit in simple steps. Here is an example of some &ldquo;How to Enter&rdquo; steps:<br />
 </p>

<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Click &ldquo;Register&rdquo; to access the submission form and start your draft early.</li>
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Visit the Resources page to learn more about the SongBox API and how to get access.</li>
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Create a working app that meets the requirements below, or update an existing app.</li>
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Create a demonstration video and take some screenshots of your app.</li>
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Provide a way for us to access your app for testing.</li>
	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Submit!</li>
</ol>

<p class="p1"><br />
<span class="s1">Note: The <b>REGISTER</b> button will only appear when the submission period has started. It will not appear in the hackathon<span class="s1"> preview.</p>

<p class="p1"><br />
<span class="s1"><b><span style="font-size:16px;">Rules</b><br />
<br />
This is where you will post detailed rules from your legal department. Please try to make them comprehensive and user-friendly so that they will be clear to people who are looking to enter your hackathon<span class="s1">.</p>

<p class="p1"><br />
<span class="s1">You will want to include eligibility requirements, judging criteria, and let potential submitters know exactly what they will have to do to enter the hackathon<span class="s1">.</p>

<p class="p1"><br />
<span class="s1">Please note: Many hackathon<span class="s1"> managers want to add a rule that states that submitters cannot make any changes to their submission after it has been entered. We advise against adding this rule because our platform allows users to edit their submissions up until the end of the submission period.</p>

<span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Submission Guidelines </strong><br />
<br />
In this section, you should provide the eligibility requirements, such as age and country of residence and the submission requirements, such as what API must be used or what problem must be solved. These will give interested hackers the basic necessary information to compete.<br />
