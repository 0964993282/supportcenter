<p class="p1">Portfolios are a great way to showcase your work. Your projects will appear in chronological order (newest to oldest) by default. You can select up to 4 of your favorite projects to remain in the top row at all times. To do this, log in to your Devpost account and click the white star in the top right corner of your favorite projects&rsquo; thumbnails:</p>
