<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Adding your judges during hackathon creation</strong><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your first task is to add the list of judges to your hackathon<span class="s1">. When you are creating your hackathon<span class="s1">, you will see a section called &ldquo;Judging&rdquo; on the dashboard. Click &ldquo;Judging&rdquo; under &ldquo;Edit Your Challenge&rdquo; to fill in the names of your judges.</p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431069"  /></p>

<p class="p4"><br />
<span class="s1"><b>Adding judges</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The information added to the Judges section is publicly displayed on your hackathon<span class="s1">, except for the judges&rsquo; email addresses and user names.</p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431071"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can add anyone with an email address as a judge. When the judging period starts, each judge will receive an email that provides a link for judging submissions. (More on this later.) The email will also ask the judge to create an account, if necessary.</p>

<p class="p4"><br />
<span class="s1"><b>Judging criteria</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After you&rsquo;ve added your panel of judges to your hackathon<span class="s1">, the next step is to add some judging criteria. The criteria serve as guidelines for both judges and submitters. Challenge.gov uses a 1-5 star rating for criteria. (More on this later.)</p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431072"  /></p>

<p class="p4"><br />
<span class="s1"><b>Dates</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The final step in setting up judging is to fill out the &ldquo;Dates&rdquo; section.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431073"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">The dates set the overall judging timeline, but the following rules also determine the timing:<br />
 </p>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Judging cannot start until all submissions have been reviewed and marked &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Judge.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<div class="li5"><span class="s1">​</div>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li5"><span class="s1">A hackathon<span class="s1"> admin must click &ldquo;Start Judging&rdquo; to start the process.</li>
</ul>

<div class="li5"><span class="s1">​</div>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Judging does not end automatically. A hackathon<span class="s1"> admin must click &ldquo;Finish Judging.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><br />

<br />
<span class="s1"><strong>Facilitating judging during the hackathon</strong></p>

<p class="p4"><br />
<span class="s1"><b>Choosing which submissions the judges will see</b></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">Let&rsquo;s say the submission period is over and you&rsquo;re thrilled with the response. You&rsquo;ve marked each submission as &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hidden.&rdquo; (Note: Submissions marked &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; will be publicly visible only after you&rsquo;ve clicked on &ldquo;Turn on Gallery.&rdquo;) However, you have too many &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; submissions for your busy judges to review, and you&rsquo;d like to narrow them down from the 100 &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; submissions to the 20 best ones for the judges to review.</p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">So how do you do this? For each submission, select a status: &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Judge.&rdquo; The judges will see only the submissions you have marked &ldquo;Judge.&rdquo; You can use the &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; status for submissions you&rsquo;re not sure about, but all submissions will eventually have to be marked &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Judge.&rdquo; <b>Please note: The judging period cannot start if any submissions are marked &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Step 1: To review your submissions, go to &ldquo;Submissions.&rdquo; </strong><br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/430511"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1"><strong>Step 2: Mark each submission as &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hidden.&rdquo;</strong><br />
 </p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431110"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1"><strong>Step 3: Mark each submission as &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; &rdquo; Maybe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Judge.&rdquo; </strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431109"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">Once you&rsquo;ve reviewed and marked all your submissions, you will have to click the &ldquo;Turn on the Gallery&rdquo; button to make the eligible submissions publicly visible. <b>Please note: The judging period cannot start until you turn on the gallery.</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We highly recommend that you do not turn the gallery off after it has been turned on. If you turn the gallery off and then on, all the submitters of entries marked &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; will receive a new email stating that their submission has been published.</p>

<p class="p4"><br />
<br />
<span class="s1"><b>Starting judging</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The judging period has started. You&rsquo;ve marked your submissions as &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Judge.&rdquo; Now it&rsquo;s time to send a message to your judges and invite them to start judging.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Click the &ldquo;Start Judging&rdquo; button under the Judging/Voting section of the dashboard. The following email will automatically be sent to your judges:<br />
 </p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431111"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1"><b>Please note that the only way that judges can start judging is to click on the link provided in this email. Each judge will receive a unique link that will work only for that judge.</b><br />
<br />
 </p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Monitoring the judges&rsquo; progress</b><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the invitations have been sent, you can check the judges&rsquo; progress on the judging dashboard.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431112"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">The dashboard shows you which judges have started judging and their scores. If the judging deadline is approaching and certain judges have not made any progress, you may want to send them a reminder.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p1"><br />
<strong><span class="s1">What judges will see</strong><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When a judge clicks the &ldquo;Start judging&rdquo; link in the email, the following page will appear.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p3"><img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431113"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">The screen shows the judging criteria, as well as the judge&rsquo;s progress through the submissions. The &ldquo;Start Judging&rdquo; button takes the judge to the first submission.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For each item in the list of criteria, the judge should assign a rating of 1-5 stars.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/1929826_en/431115"  /></p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">1 star is the lowest rating and 5 is the highest rating. (There is no other mechanism for judges to provide feedback.) For more details about the criteria, a judge can click the question mark icon next to each item in the list.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If a judge does not want to judge a particular submission because of a conflict of interest, he or she can select the &ldquo;I recuse myself&rdquo; checkbox.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After all submissions have been rated, the judge&rsquo;s work is done.<br />
 </p>

<p class="p1"><br />
<strong><span class="s1">Ending judging</strong><br />
 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can manually end judging any time after the &ldquo;Judging Period Ends&rdquo; date has passed. We leave it up to you in case you want to allow additional time for judging. Simply click &ldquo;Finish Judging&rdquo; to end judging.</p>
