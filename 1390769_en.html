      <h3>Why can’t I vote for a submission?</h3>
      <p>If you can&#39;t vote on a submission, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve already voted for that particular entry. You can vote for as many submissions as you&#39;d like, but only once per submission (i.e. you can&#39;t vote multiple times for the same submission).</p>

      <p>If you didn&#39;t already vote for the submission and are still having problems, please <a href="mailto:support@devpost.com">contact us</a>.</p>
