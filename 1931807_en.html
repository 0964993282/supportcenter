      <h3>Setting Up Prizes for Your Hackathon</h3>
      <p>This article explains the relationship between setting up prizes on the <b>Edit hackathon</b> tab and awarding prizes to winners at the end of the hackathon.</p>

      <h4>Setting up prizes on the &ldquo;Edit hackathon&rdquo; tab</h4>

      <p>You can define the prizes for your hackathon by navigating to the <b>Edit hackathon</b> tab and then <b>Prizes</b>. To set up additional prizes, simply click <b>Add Prize</b>. If you are including opt-in awards or sponsor prizes, you can select the check box before clicking <strong>Save Prize.</strong> The prize will be automatically added to your hackathon&#39;s submission form and the submission gallery filters.</p>

      <h4>Matching prizes to winners</h4>

      <p>When you award winners at the end of the hackathon, you simply drag the winners to the prizes you defined earlier.</p>

      <p>If you are ready to award the winners but haven&rsquo;t defined all the prizes, you can always go back and add them, as shown in the first image on this page.</p>
