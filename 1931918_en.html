<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>at a specific date and time</b> field defaults to the winners announcement date you defined when you first created the hackathon. But you can select any date and time to make the announcement. If you change the date and time of the announcement, it will also be changed publicly on the hackathon<span class="s1"> homepage. If you choose <b>immediately</b>, the winners will be published on the hackathon<span class="s1"> homepage immediately.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once your winners have been published, a button will appear on the homepage of your hackathon<span class="s1"> that links to the Submission Gallery where the winning submissions will be marked with a &ldquo;Winner&rdquo; ribbon. In addition, a Winners Gallery will appear on the homepage displaying the winning submissions. </p>
