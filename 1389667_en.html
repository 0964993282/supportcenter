<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Your submission may not be appearing in the gallery for a few reasons:</strong><br />
 </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Your submission hasn&#39;t been reviewed yet. </strong>Your submission is made publicly visible only after it&#39;s been reviewed by the hackathon managers. Until that happens, only you and your team members can see it.</li>
</ul>
​<br />
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>​</strong><strong>You&#39;ve edited your submission.</strong> If you edit your submission after it&#39;s been published in the gallery, it will be unpublished and sent back to the hackathon managers&#39; review queue. Until the hackathon manager re-reviews your submission, only you and your team members can see it.</li>
</ul>
​<br />
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>The submission period hasn&#39;t ended yet.</strong> Some hackathon managers choose to wait until the end of the submission period to publish submissions in the gallery. If the submission period hasn&#39;t ended yet and no submissions have been published, then this is likely why.</li>
</ul>
