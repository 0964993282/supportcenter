<strong>Updating Rules</strong><br />
<br />
We recommend avoiding updates or changes to your rules after the competition launches unless absolutely necessary. If you think it is necessary, you should consult your attorney. Here are a few practical suggestions to consider in addition to the advice from your attorney: <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Don&rsquo;t disadvantage anyone</strong>: Contestants may have started work based on the rules in place at launch. Avoid changes that could put them at a disadvantage or make them wish they had started in a different direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Don&rsquo;t do it last minute</strong>: Don&rsquo;t change dates at the last minute! Contestants who worked hard at the end may be unhappy with a last minute extension of the submission deadline or winner announcement date.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Update everywhere</strong>: If the rules change, be sure to update any related language elsewhere on the site, such as the Enter a Submission page, How to Enter, and FAQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Communicate</strong>: Communicate important changes to the rules using the communications features in the Devpost manage area. Consider:<br />
<br />
    ◦    Sending a message to anyone who has submitted already<br />
    ◦    Sending a message to anyone who has created a draft<br />
    ◦    Sending an update to people who have registered for your challenge (or include information about rules changes in your next general update)
