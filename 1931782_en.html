<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Public Voting is a great way to engage people around your hackathon<span class="s1">. We see the largest activity and traffic around a hackathon<span class="s1"> during the public voting period. We have implemented a simple but secure public voting functionality to obtain verified public votes and reduce voter fraud.</p>

 </p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each user may vote on a submission once but may vote for as many submissions as they like. This is the only voting strategy currently available on the site.</p>

<p class="p2"><br />
<span class="s1">Each user must have a verified account on the site before a vote is considered valid.</p>
