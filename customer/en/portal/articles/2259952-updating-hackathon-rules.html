      <h3>Updating Hackathon Rules</h3>
      <p>We recommend avoiding updates or changes to your rules after the competition launches unless absolutely necessary. If you think it is necessary, you should consult your attorney. Here are a few practical suggestions to consider in addition to the advice from your attorney:</p>

      <h4>Don’t disadvantage anyone</h4>
      <p>Contestants may have started work based on the rules in place at launch. Avoid changes that could put them at a disadvantage or make them wish they had started in a different direction.</p>

      <h4>Don’t do it last minute</h4>
      <p>Don’t change dates at the last minute! Contestants who worked hard at the end may be unhappy with a last minute extension of the submission deadline or winner announcement date.</p>

      <h4>Update everywhere</h4>
      <p>If the rules change, be sure to update any related language elsewhere on the site, such as the Enter a Submission page, How to Enter, and FAQ.</p>

      <h4>Communicate</h4>
      <p>Communicate important changes to the rules using the communications features in the Devpost manage area. Consider sending:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a message to anyone who has submitted already</li>
        <li>a message to anyone who has created a draft</li>
        <li>an update to people who have registered for your challenge (or include information about rules changes in your next general update)</li>
      </ul>
