      <h3>Moderating flagged discussions</h3>
      
      <p>If someone makes an inappropriate comment on the discussion forum, a user may flag the comment. As a manager, it’s your job to review and moderate these flagged comments.</p>

      <p>To check if you have any flagged comments, visit the “Discussions” tab in the hackathon management area:</p>

      <img src="/images/manage-discussions-none-flagged.jpg"/>

      <p>When a discussion comment or topic has been flagged, you’ll see it listed on that page along with the reason it was flagged:</p>

      <img src="/images/manage-discussions-flagged.png"/>

      <p>Click the “investigate” link to visit the source of the comment. From there, you can delete the comment or remove the flag if the comment was flagged incorrectly.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> when a user flags a comment, an alert email is sent to the Devpost support team. The comment is still visible to the public until a manager or Devpost support member deletes it.</p>
