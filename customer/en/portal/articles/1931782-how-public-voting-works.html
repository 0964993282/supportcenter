      <h3>Public Voting</h3>
      <p>Public Voting is a great way to engage people around your hackathon. We see the largest activity and traffic around a hackathon during the public voting period. We have implemented a simple but secure public voting functionality to obtain verified public votes and reduce voter fraud.</p>

      <h4>Setting it up</h4>

      <p>When you create your hackathon, public voting is on by default and recommended.</p>

      <h4>Turning on / off public voting</h4>

      <p>In the “Public voting” section of the “Edit Challenge” area, you can toggle public voting on or off.</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/images/1931782_en/431136"></p>

      <h4>Choosing the dates</h4>

      <p>Choose the dates that your public voting will take place in the “Dates” section of the “Edit Challenge” area. Though not recommended, you can adjust the dates at a later date.</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/images/1931782_en/431137"></p>

      <p>Leave yourself enough time to review the submissions before public voting starts. Allow at least a week and in most cases more time to review every submission.</p>

      <h4>Starting Public Voting</h4>

      <p>Public voting will start on it’s own as long as there are no more submissions to review.</p>

      <h4>If submissions are not all reviewed.</h4>

      <p>We’ll send you an email like the following:</p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/images/1931782_en/431138"></p>

      <p>Public voting will attempt to start again once those conditions are met.</p>

      <h4>What can users do?</h4>

      <p>Each user may vote on a submission once but may vote for as many submissions as they like. This is the only voting strategy currently available on the site.</p>

      <p>Each user must have a verified account on the site before a vote is considered valid.</p>
