      <h3>What’s the difference between an online hackathon and an in-person hackathon?</h3>
      <p>Location, location, location! An in-person hackathon is an event you actually attend in person, whereas an online hackathon is something you can participate in regardless of where you're located physically.</p>

      <p>Check the Official Rules of the hackathon you're interested in to see if individuals from your country are eligible to compete.</p>
