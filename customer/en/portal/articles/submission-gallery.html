      <h3>Submission gallery</h3>
      
      <p>All projects submitted to a hackathon will appear on the Submissions tab. Projects will only be visible in the submission gallery when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the hackathon manager turns on the gallery (usually happens after the submission deadline)</li>
        <li>the hackathon manager has reviewed and moderated the project</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hackathon managers:</strong> see our <a href="/customer/en/portal/articles/1929807-moderating-submissions.html">FAQ about moderating submissions and turning on the gallery</a></p>

      <p>The Submissions tab contains a search bar for easily finding a project, which indexes the project’s title, description, sponsor prizes, answers to custom questions fields, and screen names.</p>

      <p>The list of projects is default sorted by oldest projects at the top, but also includes options for sorting by recently added or project name. Depending on the hackathon’s setup preferences, some may also display filtering options on the right side of the submission gallery.</p>

      <p>Once winners have been announced, winning projects have a yellow “winner” banner on them and appear at the top of the gallery.</p>
