      <h3>Late submissions - I missed the submission deadline</h3>
      <p>If you missed the submission deadline you can ask the hackathon manager to enable late submissions in order to allow you to submit your project.</p>

      <p><em>Please note: enabling late submissions is at the discretion of the hackathon manager. Not every competition will allow late submissions. Make sure to submit early - you can update your submission until the deadline.</em></p>
