      <h3>Why can’t I vote for a submission?</h3>
      <p>If you can't vote on a submission, it's possible that you've already voted for that particular entry. You can vote for as many submissions as you'd like, but only once per submission (i.e. you can't vote multiple times for the same submission).</p>

      <p>If you didn't already vote for the submission and are still having problems, please <a href="mailto:support@devpost.com">contact us</a>.</p>
