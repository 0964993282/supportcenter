<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>Submission Period</b><br />
<br />
<strong>Online hackathons</strong> typically run from a few weeks to a few months. We recommend making the submission period at least 3 months to give submitters time to create their apps.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We highly recommend that you do not start or end a hackathon at 12 p.m. or 12 a.m., as we have found that this leads to confusion among submitters.<br />
<br />
<strong>In-person hackathons</strong> typically run 1-2 days. We recommend making the submission period start at the time and date when hackers are allowed to start working on their projects so they can get right to work.</p>

<span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>Final Reminders</b><br />
<br />
The Final Reminders text will appear at the top of the Submission form. If a user is reading this text, it means he or she has registered for the hackathon and can now access and start filling out the submission form. This is a great opportunity to briefly summarize the requirements and explain what must be included with each submission.</p>

<span class="s1"><span style="font-size:16px;"><b>File Upload</b><br />
<br />
If you are asking your submitters for any documents, you will want to set <b>File Upload</b> to <b>On.</b> It is only possible to upload one file, so if you are asking your submitters for multiple files, they will have to combine them all into one PDF or upload them all in a ZIP file. </p>
